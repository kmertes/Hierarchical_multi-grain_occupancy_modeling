# Hierarchical_multi-grain_occupancy_modeling

The characterization of speciesâ€™ environmental niches - and spatial distribution predictions based on them - are now central to much of ecology and conservation, but implicitly require decisions about the appropriate spatial scale (i.e. grain) of analysis. 

Ecological theory and empirical evidence suggest that range-resident species respond to their environment at two characteristic, hierarchical spatial grains: (i) response grain, the (relatively fine) grain at which an individual uses environmental resources, and (ii) occupancy grain, the (relatively coarse) grain equivalent to a typical home range. 

Here, we present a multi-grain (MG) occupancy model to simultaneously estimate species-environment associations at both grains.
